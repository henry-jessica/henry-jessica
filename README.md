---
Since I wrote my first program and manipulated it to produce the desired output, I was impressed! Many ideas have emerged for using the software to solve practical problems. The software world is incredible and I truly believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.

I have been working on is a Arduino Solution - Smarthome (Rep Private at moment). 
I love studying different technologies and perfecting existing skills.
My specialities include fast learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving and design patterns.
