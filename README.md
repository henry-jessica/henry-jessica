---
Since I wrote my first program and manipulated it to produce the desired output, I was impressed! Many ideas have emerged for using the software to solve practical problems. The software world is incredible and I truly believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the people's live around the world.

<p> I have been working on a Arduino Solution - Smarthome link Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8e-XA-72NU</p>

<p> I love studying different technologies and perfecting existing skills.</p>

My specialities include fast learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving and design patterns.
